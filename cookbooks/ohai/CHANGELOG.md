## v4.2.0 (2016-07-19)

- Added the ability to specify the source cookbook for the cookbook_file or template used in the ohai_plugin resource.
- Added chef_version to the metadata
- Added testing on openSUSE and switched from Rubocop to Cookstyle

## v4.1.1 (2016-06-16)

- Bump the compat_resource requirement from 12.9+ to 12.10+ to prevent random failures

## v4.1.0 (2016-05-26)

- Added the ability to use templates and pass in variables with the plugin custom resource

## v4.0.2 (2016-05-23)

- Resolve failures on Windows nodes

## v4.0.1 (2016-05-19)

- Added .rb to the name of the plugins so they actually load
- Added testing to ensure the plugins are being loaded in the chef run

## v4.0.0 (2016-05-18)

### BREAKING CHANGE:

The 4.0 release of the Ohai cookbook removes the previous cookbook_file behavior that required forking the cookbook and adding your own plugins. Instead the cookbook ships with a new ohai_plugin custom resource for installing plugins. In addition to this new custom resource the cookbook now requires Chef 12+. See the readme and test recipe for examples. If you require Chef 11 support you'll need to pin to version 3.0 in your environment.

## v3.0.1 (2016-03-14)

- Fixed the Chefspec matchers

## v3.0.0 (2016-03-14)

- Change the default value for `node['ohai']['hints_path']` to use the Ohai config value. This should be the same value in most use cases, but if a custom path is specified in the chef client config this value will get used automatically by the cookbook.
- Removed backwards compatibility with Chefspec < 4.1 in the matchers library
- Fix bad link to the custom Ohai plugin documentation in the readme
- Improve documentation for `node['ohai']['plugin_path']`

## v2.1.0 (2016-01-26)

- Properly handle creating ohai hints without specifying the content. Previously if the content wasn't specified a deprecation notice would be thrown and the file would not be created
- Simplified the test suite and added inspec tests to ensure hints are created, especially if the content is not specified
- Added FreeBSD and Windows as supported platform in the metadata and add them to the Test Kitchen config
- Add Test Kitchen integration tests to Travis CI
- Updated testing Gems to the latest releases in the Gemfile

## v2.0.4 (2015-10-30)

- Resolved deprecation warnings with the Chefspec matchers

## v2.0.3 (2015-10-21)

- Added a Chefignore file
- Resolved Rubocop warnings
- Added source_url and issues_url to the metadata
- Added Chefspec matchers
- Added basic convergence Chefspec test
